# Memory_Game

## Introduction

The Memory_Game is a project developed for the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program at Udacity.
The game's design was stablished by our mentors, but the .js code was fully developed by me.

## Contributing

Note from the Mentors:

>The files in this repository are used as the starting point for all students. Because we want students to write the majority of the code themselves, pull requests (most likely) will not be merged into the project.

As this is my first app coding, you may find that many of the loops and code could probably be better, so once the project gets submitted and hopefully approved, feel free to contribute with anything that optimizes code or even helps me improve my coding skills welcome!
